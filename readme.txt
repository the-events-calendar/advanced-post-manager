Turbo charge your posts admin for any custom post type with sortable filters and columns, and auto-registration of metaboxes.

== Description ==

This is a tool for developers who want to turbo-charge their custom post type listings with metadata, taxonomies, and more. An intuitive interface for adding (and saving) complex filtersets is provided, along with a drag-and-drop interface for choosing and ordering columns to be displayed. Metaboxes are also automatically generated for all your metadata-entry needs.

* Add columns to the post listing view
* Filter post listings by custom criteria
* Easily add metaboxes to custom post types
* Automatically add registered taxonomies to post listings
* Sort by post metadata

See docs/documentation.html in the plugin directory for full documentation.

The team at Modern Tribe stands by our work and offers light support every Wednesday to the community via the WordPress.org support forums. Feel free to ask a question if you're having a problem with implementation or if you find bugs.
